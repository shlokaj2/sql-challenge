# sql-challenge

For this assignment, we were given the scenario of being a newly hired data engineer at Pewlett Hackard (a fictional company) and were given the task to do a research project about people whom the company employed during the 1980s and 1990s. All that remains of the employee database from that period are six CSV files. (These six CSV files are included in this repository under a folder named data) We were tasked with designing the tables to hold the data from the CSV files, import the CSV files into a SQL database, and then answer questions about the data. In other words, I performed data modeling, data engineering, and data analysis tasks.

This repository includes an image of the Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) for all six tables. This is known as data modeling.
There is also an sql file called table schemata under a folder called EmployeeSQL, that shows the code for the table creations with the primary keys and foregin keys indicated and set into each table. This part is known as data engineering. 
There is another sql file called queries under the folder called EmployeeSQL as well, that shows the code for the queries or questions asked about the data provided by the six tables. This part is known as data analysis.
